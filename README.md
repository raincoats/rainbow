rainbow
=======

A shell script that turns words into \~rainbows\~.

### To run this, you need:
 - 24 bit colour support in your terminal
 - `zsh` in your `$PATH`

The colour generating function `rainbows_constructor` was lifted from github user tclamb's 24 bit colour test script, [here](https://github.com/tclamb/iTerm2/blob/d0ecb297727a59c9ee551144caeade675d9ae04b/tests/24-bit-color.sh). Specifically the function `rainbowColor`.
